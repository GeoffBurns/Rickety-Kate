"Seven Rules"="The player with the %@ starts. Players open each suite with the %@ of that suite. After the suite has been openned the players lay out the cards of the suite above and below the %@ in order, adding cards in sequence down to the ace and up to the king. If a player can not lay down a card then they 'Knock' and the turn passes to the next player. The first player to run out of cards wins the hand.";
"Rickety Kate Spades Rules"="Rickety Kate is a trick taking card game. This means every player tosses in a card and the player with the highest card in the same suite as the first card wins the trick and the cards. But wait! the person with the lowest running score wins. So winning a trick is not necessarily good.  The Queen of Spades (Rickety Kate) is worth 10 points against you and in the Spades variation of the game the other spades are worth 1 point against you. When you run out of cards you are dealt another hand. If you obtain all the spades in a hand it is called 'Shooting the Moon' and your score drops to zero. At the beginning of each hand the player pass their three worst cards to their neighbour. Aces and King are the worst cards.";
