However the scoring of this app is based on my families rules - 10 points for Queen of Spaces and 1 point for other spades

This codebase uses carthage to manage dependencies https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

I am using the reactivecocoa framework
run 'carthage build --platform iOS' from the terminal commandline while in the root directory of the project to install the reactivecocoa framework

The graphics for the cards are based on the artwork at https://github.com/notpeter/Vector-Playing-Cards with alterations made by myself

I am using a multiline label class by craig grummitt that can be found at https://gist.github.com/craiggrummitt/03bfa93c07e247ee9358
