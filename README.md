# Rickety-Kate

swift iphone app

The graphics for the cards are based on the artwork at https://github.com/notpeter/Vector-Playing-Cards with alterations made by myself

I am using a pub/sub class written by giles van gruisen that can be found at https://github.com/RemarkableIO/Publinks

I am using a multiline label class by craig grummitt that can be found at https://gist.github.com/craiggrummitt/03bfa93c07e247ee9358
Rules for rickety-kate can be found at http://australiancardgames.com.au/rickety-kate/

However I haven't implemented the card passing yet and the scoring of this app is based on my families rules 10 points for Queen of Spaces and 1 point for other spades
